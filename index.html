    <h1>Important Concepts</h1>
    <p><b>How the Web Works</b></p>
    <p>The world wide web is a web of intercommunicating computers. someone opens a website like www.google.com they are really sending a <em>HTTP request to the website's server.</em> This request tells the server to send a HTML file back in response. This file is then interpreted by your computer's <em>web browser</em> displaying a website. This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48230539/m-48742046">video</a> does a good job of explaining this.</p>
    <p><b>HTML</b></p>
    <p>HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>. HTML contains text which is rendered on your computers. HTML files make up most of the files on the intrenet. <em>Text Content</em> is "what you see" and <em>Markup</em> is "how it looks". An overview of this is available <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48724340">here</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Tags and Elements</b></p>
    <p>Although you can type plain text and it will render as text in HTML their are many limitations to that method. A more effective way to do it is elements. Elements consist of 3 parts, an <em>opening tag, content block, and a closing tag</em>. This <a href="">video</a> explains this concept more in-depth..</p>
    <p><b>Why Computers are Stupid</b></p>
    <p>Computers are literal. What you tell them to do is what they do. This causes problems when you make a typo or mistake, because it can cause huge errors in a program.</p>
    <p><b>Inline vs Block Elements</b></p>
    <p>Inline elements are, as the same suggests in line. Block elements create an "invisible box" around content inside of them.</p>
